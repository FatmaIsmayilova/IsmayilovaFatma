This project predicts numbers

1.png >>> Model predicts it as 5, because of the straight line similar with 5

2.png >>> Model predicts it as 2, down side may help it in prediction
3.png >>> Model predicts it as 1, beacuse it looks like print 1
4.png >>> Model predicts it as 8, beacuse it looks like print 9
5.png >>> Model predicts it as 6, may be the curves of number 8 help it in prediction
6.png >>> Model predicts it as 5, because it looks like 5
7.png >>> Model predicts it as 3, because it looks like print 9, and angle between straight lines may help it to predict 9
8.png >>> Model predicts it as 8, but i do not know cause
9.png >>> Model predicts it as 7, because it looks like handwriting 7
10.png >>> Model predicts it as 0, because it looks like circle as 0
